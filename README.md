# Intro to RMarkdown

This is the repo for the intro to Rmarkdown lesson from Schloss lab meeting on 1-24-18.

## Prior to lab meeting

* Clone this repo onto your laptop any way you want. I prefer to do it over the command line:

  + Navigate to the folder you want to put this lesson in and run: 
  
    `git clone https://github.com/kjflynn/rmd_labmeeting.git`
    
  + Then open RStudio and set this as your working directory 


* Download packages if you don't have them

    `install.packages('ggplot2')`

    `install.packages('rmarkdown')`

## Lab meeting exercises

* Work with your partner to replicate the RMarkdow report shown in `1_24labmeeting_solution.html`

* RStudio keeps cheatsheets under `Help > Cheatsheets > RMarkdown cheat sheet`

* I'd suggest the less-experienced-in-RMarkdown do the actual typing :) 

* Partners: 
  + Pat and Marcy
  + Will and Ada
  + Josh and Marc
  + Charlie and Kaitlin 
  
* If you finish early- add something to your report we didn't cover today 

## Advanced exercises (if we get to them)

* creating bibliographies in RMarkdown
